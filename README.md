# Shortcut Fixer

Some websites/web apps are fucking around with my custom keyboard mappings.

First, the ChatGPT website started reloading their site when I was using the CTRL+V shortcut to paste the contents of my clipboard.

And now Google Sheets started interpreting CTRL+C as CTRL+J.

How fucking retarded does one have to be to fuck around with the user's keyboard mappings?

This little extension is designed to tell those retards to fuck off and to restore the default/expected functionality for CTRL+V and CTRL+C shortcuts.
